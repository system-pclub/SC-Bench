The ERC-20 standard mandates that a `Transfer` event be emitted on successful execution of the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to indicate a transfer of tokens between accounts.\n\nIn the provided code, the `transferFrom` function calls `_transfer`, which in turn calls `_tokenTransfer` for the actual token transfer logic. However, neither `_transfer` nor `_tokenTransfer` includes an `emit` statement for the `Transfer` event.
