According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that represents the number of decimal places the token uses. This value is typically used by user interfaces and third-party applications to determine how to display the token's smallest unit.\n\nIn the given code, the `decimals()` function is returning `_decimals + 3`, which means it is not returning a constant value but a value that is 3 more than the constant `_decimals` set to 9. This results in the function returning 12, which is not fixed and deviates from the standard practice of having a constant return value for the `decimals()` function. This can lead to confusion and inconsistency in how the token's value is represented and handled in transactions and displays.",
