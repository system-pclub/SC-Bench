According to the ERC-20 standard, functions like `transfer` and `transferFrom` should return a boolean value indicating success or failure of the operation. In the provided code, the `transferFrom` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` and `_approve` operations were successful or not. This implementation can mislead other contracts or services interacting with this token, as they may interpret the transfer as failed even when it was actually successful. Proper implementation should return `true` if the operations complete successfully.",

The ERC-20 standard expects the function to return the exact amount allowed, not a modified value."
