The `msg.sender` has an adequate allowance set by the `sender`.\n2. The allowance is decremented by the amount being transferred (unless it is set to the maximum uint256 value, which is a common practice to indicate infinite approval).\n\nSince the code snippet provided does not include these checks or any reference to an allowance mapping, it violates the ERC-20 rule that requires the sender to have authorized the caller of `transferFrom` through some mechanism (typically the allowance mechanism).
