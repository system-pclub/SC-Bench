According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should return a boolean value that indicates success (`true`) or failure (`false`). In the given code, the `transfer` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually processes the transfer) completes successfully or not. This implementation can mislead users and external contracts interacting with this token, as they will receive a response indicating failure even when the transfer is successful. This is not compliant with the standard behavior expected from an ERC-20 token's `transfer` function."
