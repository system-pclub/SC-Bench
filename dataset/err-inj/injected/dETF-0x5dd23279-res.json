The function is implemented to always return `false`, regardless of whether the transfer was successful or not. According to ERC-20 standards, the function should return `true` if the transfer is successful, and `false` only if it fails. This implementation could lead to incorrect behavior in interactions with other contracts or services that rely on the success status of token transfers."
