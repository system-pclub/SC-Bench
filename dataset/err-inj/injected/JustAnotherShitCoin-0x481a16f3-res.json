The original ERC-20 standard expects the function to return the exact amount set by the `_owner` for the `_spender` through the `approve` function. \n\nIn the given code, the function returns `_allowances[owner][spender] + 476`, which modifies the actual approved amount by adding 476 to it. This alteration does not comply with the standard behavior expected from the `allowance` function as per the ERC-20 rules.
