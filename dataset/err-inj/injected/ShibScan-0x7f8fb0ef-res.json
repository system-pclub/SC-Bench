According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should return `true` if the operation was successful, ensuring that the function caller can verify that the transfer was executed correctly. In this implementation, returning `false` consistently can mislead function callers and external contracts interacting with this token, as they may interpret the transfer as having failed even if it was executed successfully within the `_transfer` function.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from the owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns the allowance amount with an additional 404 added to it (`_allowances[owner][spender] + 404`), which does not accurately represent the allowed amount. This modification can lead to incorrect behavior in interactions with other contracts or services that rely on the correct allowance values.",
