The `symbol` is instead declared as a constant variable within the contract:\n\n```solidity\nstring private constant _symbol = unicode\"\u5e01\u7279\u6bd4\";\n```\n\nThis means the contract does not have a `symbol()` function that can be called externally or from other contracts, which is a requirement of the ERC-20 standard for the `symbol` function. Instead, it uses a constant variable that is not accessible as a function. This violates the ERC-20 standard rule for the `symbol()` function.",

            "NO\n\nThe provided smart contract code for NOICTIB does not explicitly emit a 'Transfer' event for every transfer operation, including zero value transfers, as required by the ERC-20 standard. The '_transfer' function in the contract handles the logic for transferring tokens but does not include an explicit 'emit Transfer(from, to, amount)' statement for every scenario, particularly missing it in the conditional branches where certain conditions are met (like adding taxAmount to the contract's balance). This omission can lead to scenarios where a transfer does not trigger a 'Transfer' event, thus violating the ERC-20 rule that states a 'Transfer' event must be triggered when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers."
