The function implementation incorrectly returns `_allowances[owner][spender] + 1`, which adds 1 to the actual allowed amount, thus not accurately reflecting the amount that the spender is authorized to withdraw from the owner's account. This modification can lead to potential issues in the contract's behavior, especially in terms of security and expected functionality."
