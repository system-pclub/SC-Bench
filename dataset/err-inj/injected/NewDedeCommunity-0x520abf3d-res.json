According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that represents the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. In the given code, the function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in a dynamic return value of 12, rather than a constant value. This can lead to confusion and inconsistency in how the token's decimals are handled across platforms and contracts, as it deviates from the expected behavior of returning a fixed number of decimals.",
