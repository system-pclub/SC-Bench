The code correctly emits an `Approval` event indicating the new allowance amount, which is a requirement of the ERC-20 standard when allowances are set or modified.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard specifies that the `approve` function should be used to set the allowance of a spender over the owner's tokens to a new amount, effectively overwriting any previous allowance amount. The provided implementation adheres to this by directly setting the allowance to the new `amount` specified in the `approve` function call, and there is no indication in the provided code snippet that the new allowance is anything but an overwrite of any previous value.\n\nTherefore, the implementation does not violate the ERC-20 rule regarding the overwriting of allowances.",

It only requires that a `decimals` function is implemented to return the number of decimal places the token uses. This is typically used by user interfaces and is not enforced by the ERC-20 standard itself. The standard allows for flexibility in the number of decimals, and different tokens can implement different values based on their requirements.\n\nIn the provided code, the `decimals` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in 12 decimal places. While this is unusual (as most tokens use up to 18 decimals, and many use fewer), it does not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as the function correctly reports the number of decimals used throughout the token's operations and transactions. The ERC-20 standard primarily requires consistency and correct reporting of the decimals value."
