According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that defines the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. In the given code, the function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in a dynamic value (12 in this case, since `_decimals` is a constant 9). This implementation does not adhere to the standard practice of returning a fixed number of decimals, as it modifies the constant `_decimals` value by adding 3 to it. This could lead to inconsistencies and confusion regarding the token's divisibility and representation.",

Instead of returning the direct balance of the account, the function modifies the balance by adding a constant value of 848 to the result of `tokenFromReflection(_rOwned[account])`. This alteration does not comply with the standard ERC-20 implementation, where the balance should reflect the actual amount of tokens held by the address without any modification or adjustment."
