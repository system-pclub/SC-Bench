According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return the number of decimal places the token uses. This is typically a constant value to define the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes.\n\nIn the given code, the `decimals()` function is designed to return `_decimals + 3`, where `_decimals` is an immutable value set to 18. Therefore, the function will return 21, which is unconventional and could lead to confusion or incompatibility with wallets and exchanges that expect a standard implementation, where commonly the decimals are set to 18 or less. This deviation from the standard practice could potentially cause issues in how the token interacts with other contracts and platforms expecting a standard ERC-20 implementation.",
