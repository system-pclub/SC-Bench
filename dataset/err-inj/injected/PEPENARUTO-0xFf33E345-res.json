In the given code, the `_decimals` constant is set to 9, but the `decimals()` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which equals 12. This modification of the decimal value in the return statement does not accurately represent the defined smallest unit of the token as per the constant `_decimals`.

The function should verify that `_allowances[_from][msg.sender]` is greater than or equal to the `amount` being transferred, and then decrement the allowance by the `amount` transferred.\n\nIn the provided code, the `transferFrom` function directly calls `_transfer(sender, recipient, amount)` without any checks on allowances, which violates the ERC-20 standard requirement that states the function must \"throw if the _from account has not deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.\" This mechanism is typically implemented by managing allowances that the `_from` account sets for other addresses."
