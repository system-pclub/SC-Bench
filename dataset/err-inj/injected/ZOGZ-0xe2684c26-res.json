However, in the given code, the function returns the value of `_allowances[owner][spender]` incremented by 514, which does not accurately represent the allowed amount. This modification can lead to incorrect behavior in interactions with other contracts or services that rely on the correct implementation of the ERC-20 `allowance` function.",

The provided implementation of `_approve` does not include the emission of this event, thus violating the ERC-20 rule."
