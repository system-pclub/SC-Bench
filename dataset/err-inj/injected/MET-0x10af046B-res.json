This is typically managed by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that `msg.sender` has a sufficient allowance to transfer the specified amount from the `_from` address. However, the provided `transferFrom` function directly calls `_transfer` without such a check, thereby potentially violating the ERC-20 standard requirement that states \"throw if the _from account has not deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism\"."
