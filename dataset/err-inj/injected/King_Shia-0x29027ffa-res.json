However, the function returns `false` unconditionally, which is not typical behavior for an ERC-20 `approve` function. Normally, the `approve` function should return `true` to indicate successful approval unless there is an error that prevents the approval from being set. The unconditional return of `false` could mislead users or interfacing contracts about the success of the operation, despite the allowance actually being set correctly as per the `_approve` internal function and the emitted `Approval` event. This could be considered a violation of expected behavior under ERC-20 standards, even though the technical requirement of setting the allowance is met.",
