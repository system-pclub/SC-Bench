According to ERC-20, the `symbol()` function should return a short string symbolizing the token, typically used as a ticker or abbreviation (e.g., \"ETH\" for Ethereum). Returning an empty string does not provide any useful information about the token, thus violating the ERC-20 standard requirement for the `symbol()` function.",

This is crucial for defining the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. In the provided code, the `decimals` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which means it does not return a constant value but rather a value that is derived by adding 3 to the `_decimals` constant. This implementation could lead to confusion and inconsistency regarding the token's divisibility, as it deviates from the expected behavior of returning a fixed number of decimals as defined by the ERC-20 standard."
