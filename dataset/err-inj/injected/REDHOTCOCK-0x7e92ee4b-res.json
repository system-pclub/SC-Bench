According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should return a boolean value that indicates whether the operation was successful. In this implementation, it always returns `false`, regardless of whether the transfer actually succeeds or not, which can mislead other contracts or services interacting with this token contract into thinking that all transfers have failed.
