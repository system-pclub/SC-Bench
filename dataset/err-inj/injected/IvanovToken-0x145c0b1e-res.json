It only requires that a `decimals` function is implemented to return the number of decimal places the token can be divided into. This is typically used for display purposes and to determine the smallest unit of the token.\n\nIn the provided code, the `decimals` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in 12 decimal places. Although this is not a common number of decimals (as many tokens use 18, like Ether, or 2, like US Dollar representations), it does not violate the ERC-20 standard. The standard allows for flexibility in the number of decimals a token can have, as long as it is clearly defined and implemented in the contract.",
            "YES\n\nThe provided code for the `transferFrom` function in the `IvanovToken` contract does not explicitly check if the `_from` account has authorized the `msg.sender` to transfer tokens on its behalf. This is a requirement according to ERC-20 standards, which state that a transfer of tokens on behalf of another account can only occur if the `_from` account has explicitly authorized the sender (via the `approve` function) to spend a specific amount of tokens.\n\nIn the given code, the `transferFrom` function calls `_transfer` directly without checking the allowance set by `_from` for the `msg.sender`. This violates the ERC-20 rule that requires checking if the `msg.sender` has been authorized by `_from` to spend the tokens. The correct implementation should include a check against the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has sufficient allowance to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the `_from` account. If the allowance is insufficient, the transaction should revert.\n\nHere is the missing check that should be included in `transferFrom`:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(_allowances[sender][msg.sender] >= amount, \"ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance\");\n_allowances[sender][msg.sender] = _allowances[sender][msg.sender].sub(amount);\n```\n\nThis check ensures that the `msg.sender` has the necessary allowance to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the `sender` account, adhering to the ERC-20 standard requirements.",
