According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that defines the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. In the given code, the function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in 21 decimal places. This is not a constant return value as expected by the standard, because it modifies the originally defined constant `_decimals` of 18 by adding 3 to it. This could lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior in token handling and display across platforms that interact with this token."
