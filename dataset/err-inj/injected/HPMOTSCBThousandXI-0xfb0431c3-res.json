Instead of returning the constant total supply defined by `_tTotal`, the function modifies this value by adding 534 to it, which results in a different value being returned each time the function is called. This is not compliant with the standard behavior expected from the `totalSupply()` function according to the ERC-20 token standard, which should consistently return the total number of tokens in circulation (a constant value in this case)."
