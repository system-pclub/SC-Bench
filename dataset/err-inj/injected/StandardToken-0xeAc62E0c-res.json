In the provided code, the `approve` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the approval operation (handled by `_approve`) was actually successful or not. According to ERC-20 standards, the `approve` function should return `true` to indicate a successful approval. The constant return of `false` misleads the function callers about the outcome of the approval process, which is not compliant with the standard expectations of the ERC-20 `approve` function.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `symbol` function should return a string representing the symbol of the token. In the given code, the `symbol` function is implemented to always return an empty string (`\"\"`), which does not provide any meaningful symbol for the token. This does not meet the intent of the ERC-20 standard which expects a symbol that typically represents a shorter version of the token's name, aiding in its identification and use within the ecosystem."
