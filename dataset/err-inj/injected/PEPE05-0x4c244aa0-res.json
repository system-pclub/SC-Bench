According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. Typically, this should return `true` if the approval was successful.\n\nIn the given code, the `approve` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_approve` internal function successfully sets the allowance or not. This behavior can mislead the function callers about the outcome of the approval process, as it does not accurately reflect the success of the operation. This is a violation of the ERC-20 standard's requirement for the `approve` function.",
            "NO.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard does not specify a fixed number of decimals that must be used; it only requires that a `decimals` function is implemented to return the number of decimal places the token can be divided into. This is typically used for display and transaction purposes to define the smallest unit of the token.\n\nIn the provided code, the `decimals` function is implemented and returns a value (`_decimals + 3`, which equals 12). Although this is not a common number of decimals (as most tokens use 18, like Ether, or 2, like many fiat currencies), it does not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as the function returns a uint8 value indicating the number of decimal places. The ERC-20 standard does not enforce a specific value for decimals; it only requires that the function exists and returns a uint8. Thus, the interface does not violate the ERC-20 rule regarding decimals."
