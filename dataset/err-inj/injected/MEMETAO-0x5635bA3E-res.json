According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from the owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns the allowance amount with an additional 621 units added to it (`_allowances[owner][spender] + 621`), which does not accurately reflect the actual allowed amount. This modification can lead to incorrect behavior in interactions with other contracts or services that rely on the correct allowance values, potentially causing security and functionality issues.",

This modification does not accurately reflect the true balance of the account, thus violating the ERC-20 standard requirement."
