According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that defines the smallest unit of the token. In the given code, the function returns `_decimals + 3`, which is not a constant value but rather a modification of the `_decimals` constant, making it dynamic and potentially misleading. This does not adhere to the standard practice of defining a fixed number of decimal places for token divisibility and display purposes.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should return `true` if the operation was successful, ensuring that the function caller can verify the success of the token transfer. The unconditional return of `false` in this function implementation can mislead function callers and external contracts interacting with this token, as it suggests that the transfer has failed even when it may have succeeded. This is a critical issue in terms of contract reliability and trustworthiness in the Ethereum ecosystem."
