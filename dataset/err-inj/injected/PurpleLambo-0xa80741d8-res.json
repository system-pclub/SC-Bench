While this is unusual compared to many common ERC-20 tokens which often use 18 decimal places (like Ether), or sometimes fewer (such as 2 or 8), it does not violate the ERC-20 standard. The standard allows for any number of decimals to be defined by the contract as long as the `decimals` function correctly reports this number. Thus, the implementation does not violate the ERC-20 rule regarding decimals.",
