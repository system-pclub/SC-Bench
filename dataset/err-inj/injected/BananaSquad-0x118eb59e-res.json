In the `transferFrom` function, the actual transfer of tokens is handled by the `_transfer` function. However, the code snippet provided does not show the implementation of the `transferFrom` function checking or updating the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has been authorized by the `_from` account to spend the tokens.\n\nThe `_transfer` function itself does not check for any allowances or permissions specifically related to `transferFrom`. It only performs the transfer based on the parameters passed to it, which means the responsibility to check for allowances should logically be in the `transferFrom` function itself or in another function that `_transfer` relies on for this check.\n\nSince the provided code does not include the logic to verify that the `msg.sender` has an adequate allowance from the `_from` account before performing a transfer on their behalf, it does not adhere to the standard ERC-20 `transferFrom` behavior. This could potentially allow unauthorized transfers, violating the ERC-20 rule mentioned. However, without seeing the complete implementation of `transferFrom` that includes the allowance check, we cannot definitively say that the rule is violated based on the provided snippet alone. The answer assumes that the necessary checks are not implemented elsewhere in the contract not shown in the snippet.",
