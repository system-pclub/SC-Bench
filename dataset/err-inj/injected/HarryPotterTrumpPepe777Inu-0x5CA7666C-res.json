This is typically done by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has a sufficient allowance to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the `_from` account. The function directly calls `_transfer` without any such checks, thereby violating the ERC-20 rule that requires explicit authorization for transfers from a third party. This can lead to unauthorized transfers, making the contract non-compliant with standard ERC-20 security practices.",

Instead of returning a constant total supply, the function adds 385 to `_tTotal`, which results in a different value than the originally defined total supply of tokens. This modification does not adhere to the standard requirement of returning the constant total token supply."
