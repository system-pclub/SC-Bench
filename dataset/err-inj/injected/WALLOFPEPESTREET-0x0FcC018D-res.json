According to ERC-20 standards, the `approve` function should return a boolean value indicating whether the approval was successful. Typically, this means returning `true` if the operation succeeds without errors. In this implementation, the function misleadingly returns `false` even after successfully setting the allowance, which violates the ERC-20 rule that states the function should indicate whether the approval was successful. This could lead to incorrect assumptions in other contracts or interfaces interacting with this contract, expecting a `true` value upon successful approval.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from an owner. In the given code, the function returns the allowance amount with an additional 993 added to it (`_allowances[owner][spender] + 993`), which does not accurately represent the allowance set by the owner for the spender. This modification can lead to incorrect behavior in transactions and mismanagement of token allowances."
