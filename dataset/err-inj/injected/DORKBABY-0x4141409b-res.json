The ERC-20 standard requires that a transfer of tokens on behalf of another account can only occur if the `_from` account has explicitly authorized the sender. This is typically managed through the allowance mechanism, which is checked (`require(currentAllowance >= amount, \"ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance\")`), but there is no additional mechanism or check to ensure that this allowance was deliberately set by the `_from` account, such as requiring some form of direct or additional confirmation from the `_from` account.\n\nTherefore, the function could potentially violate the ERC rule if allowances were somehow set without the direct authorization of the `_from` account (e.g., through a bug or security exploit in another part of the contract). The code should ideally include safeguards or checks that the `_from` account has indeed authorized the spender explicitly for the amount being transferred."
