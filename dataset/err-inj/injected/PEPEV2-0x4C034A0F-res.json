According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should return `true` if the operation is successful. However, in the given code, the `transfer` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually processes the transfer) completes successfully or not. This implementation can mislead other contracts or services interacting with this token contract into thinking that all transfers have failed, even when they may have succeeded.",

This is typically managed by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has enough allowance to transfer the specified amount from the `_from` address. However, in the provided code, there is no such check in the `transferFrom` function or the `_transfer` function that it calls. This omission means that any address could potentially call `transferFrom` to move tokens from any other address without the necessary authorization, which violates the ERC-20 standard requirement for explicit authorization.",
