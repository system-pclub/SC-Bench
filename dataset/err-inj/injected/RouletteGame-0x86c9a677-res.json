This is implemented through the allowance mechanism, where the `transferFrom` function checks if the `msg.sender` has sufficient allowance from the `_from` account to perform the transfer. If the allowance is not unlimited (checked against `type(uint).max`), it deducts the transferred amount from the allowance. This ensures that the `_from` account has authorized the transfer, complying with the ERC-20 rules.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, an `Approval` event should be emitted whenever the `approve` function is successfully called to notify the network of the approval (i.e., a change in allowance). The absence of this event emission in the code violates the ERC-20 standard rules."
