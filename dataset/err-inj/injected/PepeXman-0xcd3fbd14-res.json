The function should verify that `_allowances[_from][msg.sender]` is greater than or equal to the `amount` being transferred, and then decrement the allowance accordingly.\n\nHowever, in the provided code, the `transferFrom` function directly calls `_transfer` without any checks on allowances, which violates the ERC-20 standard rule that requires explicit authorization.
