According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that defines the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. In the given code, the function returns `_decimals + 3`, which is not a constant value but rather a modification of the `_decimals` constant, leading to potential confusion and inconsistency in how the token's decimals are handled and displayed. This could affect interoperability and the correct functioning of the token within the broader Ethereum ecosystem.",
