However, the actual updating of the allowance value in a mapping (typically something like `allowances[owner][spender] = amount;`) is not shown in the provided snippet. This might be handled elsewhere in the contract code not included in the snippet.\n\nThe key point is that the ERC-20 rule is about the requirement that the new allowance value set by the `approve` function must replace the previous value for that owner-spender pair. The provided code does not show any violation of this rule, but it also does not show the actual updating of the allowance mapping, which is critical for fully implementing the `approve` functionality according to the ERC-20 standard. The absence of this in the snippet does not necessarily mean the rule is violated; it simply isn't demonstrated in the provided code.",
