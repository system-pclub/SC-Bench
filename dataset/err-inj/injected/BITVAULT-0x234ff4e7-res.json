This is typically done by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has a sufficient allowance to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the `_from` account. The absence of this check can lead to unauthorized transfers, violating the ERC-20 standard requirement that states \"throw if the _from account has not deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism\".",

Instead of returning the actual balance stored in `_balances[account]`, the function adds 568 to the balance, which is not compliant with the standard behavior expected from the `balanceOf` function as defined in the ERC-20 token standard. The standard expects the function to return the exact number of tokens that an account holds, without any modification or calculation."
