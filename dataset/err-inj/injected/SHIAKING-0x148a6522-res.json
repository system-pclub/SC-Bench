According to ERC-20 standards, the `symbol()` function should return a short string symbol of the token, which typically represents the token's name or identifier. Returning an empty string does not adhere to the typical usage and expectation of the `symbol()` function to provide meaningful information about the token. Therefore, this implementation can be considered as violating the ERC-20 rule that requires the `symbol()` function to return a \"string, the symbol of the token\" that should be descriptive or indicative of the token's identity.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, it is required to emit a `Transfer` event whenever tokens are transferred, including both direct transfers and transfers done as part of allowance usage (like in `transferFrom`). The absence of this event emission in the `_transfer` function violates the ERC-20 standard rules."
