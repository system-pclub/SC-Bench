Returning an empty string does not meet this requirement, as it does not provide any meaningful identification for the token.

ERC-20 does not specify a fixed number of decimals; it only requires that a `decimals` function is implemented to return the number of decimal places the token can be divided into. This is typically used for display and transaction purposes to define the smallest unit of the token.\n\nIn the given code, the `decimals` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which is `9 + 3 = 12`. While this is an unusual choice (as most tokens use up to 18 decimals, and many use fewer), it is not a violation of the ERC-20 standard. The standard allows the implementation to choose any number of decimals, as long as it is clearly defined and returned by the `decimals` function."
