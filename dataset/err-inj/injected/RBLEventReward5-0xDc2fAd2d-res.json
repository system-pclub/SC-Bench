According to the ERC-721 standard, when transferring tokens to a contract, it is necessary to check if the contract implements the `onERC721Received` function to safely handle the token. This is crucial to prevent tokens from being locked in contracts that do not expect to receive them.\n\nIn the standard implementation, `_checkOnERC721Received` should attempt to call `onERC721Received` on the `to` address and verify that the call returns the expected magic value. However, since the function in the provided code does not perform this check and instead returns `true` unconditionally, it violates the ERC-721 rule that requires calling `onERC721Received` if `to` is a smart contract. This can lead to scenarios where tokens are transferred to contracts that do not support handling them, potentially resulting in lost or locked tokens."
