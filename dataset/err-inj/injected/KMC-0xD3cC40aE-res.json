The implementation in the `KMC` contract, which extends `ERC721`, correctly checks these conditions through the `_isApprovedOrOwner` function call within the `safeTransferFrom` method of the `ERC721` base contract. This function ensures that the caller (`msg.sender`) is either the owner of the token, an approved address, or an authorized operator before proceeding with the transfer. If the caller does not meet these conditions, the function will revert with an appropriate error message, thus adhering to the ERC-721 standard requirements.",
