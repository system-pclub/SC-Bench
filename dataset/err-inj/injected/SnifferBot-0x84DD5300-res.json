This is typically managed by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `sender` of the transaction (often `msg.sender` in Solidity) is allowed to transfer the specified `amount` of tokens from the `_from` account.\n\nIn the provided code, the `transferFrom` function simply calls the `_transfer` function without any checks on allowances, which should have been decremented or verified against the amount being transferred.
