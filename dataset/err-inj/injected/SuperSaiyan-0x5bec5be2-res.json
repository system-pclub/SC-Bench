According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. Typically, this should return `true` when the approval is successfully recorded.\n\nIn the given code, the `approve` function always returns `false` regardless of whether the `_approve` function successfully sets the allowance or not. This implementation can mislead users and other contracts interacting with this function into thinking that the approval has failed when it may have succeeded.

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the amount of tokens that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from an owner. However, in the given code, the function returns `_allowances[owner][spender] + 327`, which artificially inflates the allowed amount by 327 tokens. This modification does not accurately reflect the actual allowed amount set by the owner for the spender, thus violating the standard's requirement."
