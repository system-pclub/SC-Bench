The `emit Approval(owner, spender, amount);` line indicates that an `Approval` event is emitted with the new allowance value, which is a typical way to signal that the allowance has been updated to the new amount.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the actual mechanism to store and retrieve the allowance value (typically managed in a mapping like `mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) private _allowances;`) is not shown in the provided code snippet. Assuming that the `_approve` function correctly updates this mapping (or equivalent storage) to reflect the new allowance, the implementation would be compliant with the ERC-20 standard requirement. The code snippet provided does not show any logic that would append or increment the allowance, but rather it is structured in a way that suggests it sets (or would set) the allowance to a new value directly, thus overwriting the previous value.",
