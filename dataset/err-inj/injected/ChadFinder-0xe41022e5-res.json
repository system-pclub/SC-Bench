            "NO\n\nThe provided code does not violate the ERC-20 rule that \"_spender overwrites the current allowance with _value.\" The function `approve` in the `ERC20` contract correctly sets the allowance for a spender over the caller's tokens by calling the internal function `_approve`, which sets the allowance amount directly and emits an `Approval` event. This behavior is compliant with the ERC-20 standard, which requires that any existing allowance be overwritten by the new value specified in the `approve` call. The code does not show the actual storage of the allowance value (typically managed in a mapping like `mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) private _allowances;`), but the description and structure imply that `_approve` handles the allowance correctly according to the standard.",
            "NO\n\nThe provided code does not violate the ERC-20 rule requiring the emission of a 'Transfer' event when tokens are transferred. However, the actual emission of the 'Transfer' event is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet. It is mentioned in the comment of the `_transfer` function that a `{Transfer}` event is emitted, but the actual `emit` statement is not visible in the provided code. This could be due to the snippet being incomplete or the actual event emission being handled in another part of the code not shown here (such as within the `_afterTokenTransfer` method or elsewhere).\n\nIn typical ERC-20 implementations, the `emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);` line would be present in the `_transfer` function or a related function that is called during the transfer process. The comment in the `_transfer` function suggests that the event emission is intended and should be part of the complete implementation. Therefore, based on the information given and typical ERC-20 implementation practices, the interface does not violate the ERC rule regarding the emission of the 'Transfer' event, assuming the event is indeed emitted in the complete code.",
            "NO\n\nThe code provided does not violate the ERC-20 rule regarding the number of decimals a token can have. The ERC-20 standard does not specify a maximum number of decimals a token must adhere to; it only requires that a `decimals` function is implemented to define how many decimal places the token can be divided into for display and transaction purposes. \n\nIn the given code, the `decimals` function returns `18 + 3`, which equals `21`. This is unusual as most tokens use up to 18 decimals (similar to Ether), but it is not a violation of the ERC-20 standard. The standard allows for flexibility in the number of decimals, and the implementation can choose any value, as long as it is clearly defined and used consistently across the contract's functions for display purposes."
