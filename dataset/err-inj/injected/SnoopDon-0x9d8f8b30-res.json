            "YES\n\nThe provided Solidity code for the `transferFrom` function in the `SnoopDon` contract does not explicitly check if the `_from` account has authorized the `msg.sender` to spend tokens on its behalf before proceeding with the transfer. This is a requirement according to the ERC-20 standard, which mandates that there should be a mechanism to ensure that the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message (typically through the `approve` function and the `_allowances` mapping).\n\nIn the given code, the `transferFrom` function simply calls `_transfer` without checking the `_allowances` mapping to verify if the `msg.sender` has enough allowance to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the `_from` address. This oversight can lead to unauthorized transfers, violating the ERC-20 standard's rules on token authorization and security.\n\nTo comply with the ERC-20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should include a check like:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(_allowances[_from][msg.sender] >= amount, \"ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance\");\n```\n\nAnd should also update the allowance accordingly after a successful transfer:\n\n```solidity\n_allowances[_from][msg.sender] = _allowances[_from][msg.sender].sub(amount);\n```\n\nThese steps are crucial to ensure that the `_from` account has indeed authorized the transfer, thereby adhering to the ERC-20 rules.",
            "YES\n\nThe code provided violates the ERC-20 rule that the `totalSupply` function should return the total token supply. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `totalSupply` function should consistently return the total amount of tokens in circulation, which should be a fixed value as defined by the contract. In the given code, the function `totalSupply` returns `_tTotal + 472`, which deviates from the constant `_tTotal` defined as the total supply. This additional 472 tokens added to `_tTotal` in the return statement does not align with the standard requirement of returning the predefined total supply of tokens.",
            "NO.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard does not specify a fixed number of decimals that must be used; it only requires that a `decimals` function is implemented to return the number of decimal places the token can be divided into. This is typically used for display purposes and to determine the smallest unit of the token. The actual number of decimals can vary between different tokens. In the provided code, the `decimals` function returns 12 (9 + 3), which is a valid implementation as long as it is consistent with how the token's arithmetic and smallest unit are handled elsewhere in the contract. Thus, this does not violate the ERC-20 rule regarding the implementation of a `decimals` function."
