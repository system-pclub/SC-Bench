The implementation correctly checks whether the caller (`_msgSender()`) is either the owner of the token or an authorized operator by using the condition:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(\n    _msgSender() == owner || isApprovedForAll(owner, _msgSender()),\n    \"ERC721: approve caller is not owner nor approved for all\"\n);\n```\n\nThis condition ensures that the function will revert if neither of these conditions is true, thereby adhering to the ERC-721 standard requirements."
