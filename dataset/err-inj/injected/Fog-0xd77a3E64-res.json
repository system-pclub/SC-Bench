The ERC-20 standard does not specify a maximum or exact number of decimals required; it only specifies that the `decimals()` function should return the number of decimal places the token uses. In this code, the function returns `_decimals + 3`, which is `9 + 3 = 12`. This is a valid implementation as long as it consistently represents the divisibility of the token throughout the contract and its transactions. The ERC-20 standard allows for flexibility in the number of decimals a token can have.",

Instead of returning the actual balance from the `_balances` mapping, the function adds 3 to the balance, which does not accurately reflect the true balance of the account. This modification of the balance is not compliant with the standard behavior expected from the `balanceOf` function as defined in the ERC-20 token standard."
