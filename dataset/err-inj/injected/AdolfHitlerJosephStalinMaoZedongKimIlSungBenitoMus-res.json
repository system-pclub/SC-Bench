The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `decimals` function should return the number of decimal places the token can be divided into, but it does not specify a limit on what this value can be. In the given code, the `decimals` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which is `9 + 3 = 12`. This is still a valid implementation as it defines the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes, even though the number of decimals is higher than typical ERC-20 tokens (which commonly use 18 decimals). The function correctly returns a uint8 value representing the number of decimals.",

However, in the given code, the `totalSupply` function returns `_tTotal + 563`, which modifies the total supply by adding an arbitrary number (563) to `_tTotal`. This does not reflect a fixed total supply and thus does not adhere to the standard requirement of returning the total token supply accurately and consistently."
