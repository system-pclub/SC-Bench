This is typically managed by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `sender` has enough allowance to transfer the specified `amount` of tokens from the `_from` account. The function should verify that `_allowances[_from][msg.sender]` is greater than or equal to `amount` before proceeding with the transfer, and then decrement the allowance accordingly.\n\nHowever, in the provided code, the `transferFrom` function directly calls `_transfer` without any checks on allowances, thereby violating the ERC-20 standard rule that requires explicit authorization (via allowance mechanism) for transfers on behalf of another account. This can lead to unauthorized transfers, making the contract non-compliant with the ERC-20 standard regarding the `transferFrom` functionality.",
