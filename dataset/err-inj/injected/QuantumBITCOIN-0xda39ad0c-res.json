According to ERC-20 standards, the `name()` function should return the name of the token, such as \"MyToken\". Returning an empty string does not meet this requirement, as it does not provide a meaningful or identifiable name for the token. Therefore, this implementation violates the ERC rule that requires the function to return a string representing the name of the token.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should indicate whether the operation was successful by returning a boolean value, typically `true` for a successful transfer and `false` if the transfer failed. In this implementation, the function does not correctly reflect the outcome of the transfer operation, as it returns `false` regardless of whether the `_transfer` function executed successfully or not. This can lead to incorrect assumptions and handling in the calling code, potentially causing issues in interaction with other contracts or services expecting standard ERC-20 behavior.",

In the given implementation, the function returns `_tTotal + 402`, which means it does not return the constant total supply as defined (`_tTotal`), but rather a modified value. This does not adhere to the standard requirement of returning the unaltered total token supply."
