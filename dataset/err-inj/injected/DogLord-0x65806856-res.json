This is used to define the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. In the provided code, the `decimals` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which means it does not return a constant value but rather a value that is always 3 more than the constant `_decimals`. This implementation could lead to confusion and inconsistency regarding the token's divisibility and does not adhere to the typical expectations of the `decimals` function as per ERC-20 standards. Therefore, this function violates the ERC rule regarding the consistent return of decimal places for the token.",
            "YES\n\nThe function `approve` in the provided code violates the ERC-20 rule that requires indicating whether the approval was successful. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should return `true` to indicate successful approval. However, in the given code, the `approve` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the approval operation was successful or not. This behavior does not correctly communicate the outcome of the approval to the caller, which is against the ERC-20 standard requirements."
