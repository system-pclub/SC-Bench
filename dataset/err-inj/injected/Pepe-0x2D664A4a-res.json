This is typically managed through an allowance mechanism in ERC-20 tokens, which involves maintaining a mapping of allowances and checking this mapping in the `transferFrom` function to ensure that the `msg.sender` has been authorized to spend the specified amount of tokens from the `_from` account. The absence of such a check means that any address could potentially invoke `transferFrom` to move tokens between accounts without proper authorization, violating the ERC-20 standard requirement.",

However, the function does not actually update the allowance mapping that should store the amount of tokens that `spender` is allowed to withdraw from `owner`. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should not only emit an event but also set the allowance in a mapping such as `mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) public allowances;` to the specified `amount`.\n\nSince the provided code lacks the implementation to update or overwrite the current allowance value in a mapping, it violates the ERC-20 rule that \"_spender overwrites the current allowance with _value_.\" The code only emits an event without modifying any state that tracks the allowances, which is insufficient for complying with the ERC-20 standard."
