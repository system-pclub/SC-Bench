This is a requirement according to ERC-20 standards, where the allowance mechanism must be used to check and update the allowed amount before performing a transfer on behalf of another account.\n\nIn the ERC-20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should typically include checks against the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has been authorized by the `_from` account to spend at least the `amount` of tokens being transferred. The allowance should then be decreased by the `amount` transferred after the check passes.\n\nThe provided code snippet lacks these checks and updates to the `_allowances` mapping within the `transferFrom` function, thus violating the ERC-20 rule that requires explicit authorization checks before transferring tokens on behalf of another account.",
            "YES\n\nThe provided code for the `GondolaCoin` contract's `transferFrom` function does not explicitly emit the `Transfer` event as required by the ERC-20 standard. The ERC-20 standard mandates that a `Transfer` event be emitted on successful execution of the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to indicate the movement of tokens between addresses. This event is crucial for tracking token transfers on the blockchain.\n\nIn the given code, while the `_transfer` function is called within `transferFrom`, there is no visible implementation of the `Transfer` event emission within the `_transfer` function or anywhere else in the provided code snippet. This omission means that the contract does not comply with the ERC-20 standard regarding event emissions, which could lead to issues with ERC-20 token trackers and services that rely on these events for accurate information.",
            "YES\n\nThe code provided violates the ERC-20 standard rule for the `allowance` function. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from an owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns the allowance amount with an additional 87 units (`_allowances[owner][spender] + 87`). This modification does not accurately reflect the allowed amount and thus violates the standard's requirement for this function."
