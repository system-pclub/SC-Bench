The ERC-20 standard mandates that a `Transfer` event be emitted on successful execution of the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to indicate the movement of tokens between addresses. This event is crucial for external entities and blockchain explorers to track and record token transactions.\n\nIn the provided code, while the `_transfer` function is called within `transferFrom`, there is no visible implementation of the `Transfer` event emission within the `_transfer` function code snippet provided. If the `Transfer` event is not emitted elsewhere within the `_transfer` method or any method it calls, this would be a violation of the ERC-20 standard."
