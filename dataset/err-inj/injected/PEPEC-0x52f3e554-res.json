This is typically used for display purposes. The code provided does implement the `decimals` function, which returns an integer value. Although the function returns a value that is modified from the constant `_decimals` (by adding 3 to it), this does not violate the ERC-20 standard. The standard does not enforce what the value should be, only that the function exists and returns a uint8 representing the number of decimals. Thus, the interface does not violate the ERC-20 rule regarding the implementation of the `decimals` function.",
            "YES\n\nThe code provided for the `symbol()` function in the `PEPEC` contract returns an empty string (`\"\"`). According to ERC-20 standards, the `symbol()` function should return a short string symbol of the token, typically used to represent the token on exchanges and wallets. Returning an empty string does not conform to the typical usage and expectation of a token symbol in ERC-20 tokens, as it does not provide any meaningful identifier for the token. Therefore, this implementation can be considered as violating the ERC-20 rule that requires a token symbol to be a meaningful string."
