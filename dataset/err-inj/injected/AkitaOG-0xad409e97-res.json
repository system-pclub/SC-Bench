The function is implemented to always return `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually performs the transfer) completes successfully or not. This implementation does not correctly reflect the outcome of the token transfer operation, which should return `true` upon a successful transfer according to the ERC-20 standard.",

This is typically managed by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has enough allowance to transfer the specified `amount` of tokens from the `sender` to the `recipient`. The function should decrement the allowance by the amount being transferred, ensuring that the `msg.sender` cannot transfer more than they are authorized to.\n\nHowever, in the provided code, the `transferFrom` function simply calls `_transfer(sender, recipient, amount)` without any checks on allowances. This violates the ERC-20 standard rule that requires checking if the `_from` account has authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism (typically the allowance mechanism). This can lead to unauthorized transfers, making the function non-compliant with the ERC-20 standard.",
