Instead of returning the actual balance stored in `_balances[account]`, the function adds 251 to the balance before returning it. This modification does not accurately reflect the true balance of the account, thus violating the ERC-20 standard requirement.",

This is typically used for display and transaction purposes to define the smallest unit of the token.\n\nIn the provided code, the `decimals` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in 12 decimal places. While this is unusual compared to the more common 18 or fewer decimals seen in many ERC-20 tokens, it does not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as the function correctly reports the number of decimals used throughout the token contract for calculations and transactions. The ERC-20 standard allows for flexibility in the choice of decimals.",
