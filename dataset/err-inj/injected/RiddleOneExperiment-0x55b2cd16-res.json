In the given code, the `transfer` function is implemented as follows:\n\n```solidity\nfunction transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {\n    _transfer(_msgSender(), recipient, amount);\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually handles the transfer logic) succeeds or not. This is incorrect behavior according to the ERC-20 standard, which expects the function to return `true` if the transfer is successful. The correct implementation should evaluate the success of the `_transfer` call and return `true` if the transfer completes successfully, and `false` otherwise.",
