According to the ERC-721 standard, the function should throw an error if `_tokenId` does not represent a valid NFT. However, the code does not include a check to ensure that `_tokenId` is currently owned by any address before executing the transfer, which is a requirement for the token to be considered valid.\n\nThe `_transfer` function, which is called by `transferFrom`, also does not include a check to verify the existence of the token (i.e., that `_owners[tokenId]` is not zero). This omission means that the function could potentially execute a transfer of a non-existent token, which violates the ERC-721 standard requirement to throw an error if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT."
