The function should include a check like:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(_allowances[_from][msg.sender] >= amount, \"ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance\");\n```\n\nAnd should also decrement the allowance appropriately:\n\n```solidity\n_allowances[_from][msg.sender] = _allowances[_from][msg.sender].sub(amount);\n```\n\nSince these checks and updates to the `_allowances` mapping are missing in the `transferFrom` function, it violates the ERC-20 rule that requires explicit authorization for transfers on behalf of another account.",
