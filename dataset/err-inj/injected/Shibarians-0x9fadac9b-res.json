This is typically managed by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `sender` (the caller of `transferFrom`) has a sufficient allowance to transfer the specified `amount` of tokens from the `_from` account.\n\nIn the provided code, the `transferFrom` function directly calls `_transfer` without any checks on allowances, which violates the ERC-20 standard rule that requires verifying that the `_from` account has authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism (typically through the `approve` function that updates the `_allowances` mapping).\n\nThis oversight can lead to unauthorized transfers, allowing any user to transfer tokens from any account without consent, which is a critical security issue in the context of ERC-20 token standards.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should return `true` if the operation was successful. However, in the given code, the `approve` function always returns `false`, regardless of the successful execution of the `_approve` function.
