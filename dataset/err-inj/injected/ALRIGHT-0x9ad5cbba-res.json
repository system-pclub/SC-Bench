According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. However, in the given code, the `transfer` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually processes the transfer) completes successfully or not. This implementation does not correctly communicate the outcome of the transfer operation to the caller, which is a requirement of the ERC-20 standard.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that defines the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. In the given code, the function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in a dynamic value (11 in this case, since `_decimals` is a constant 8). This implementation does not adhere to the standard practice of returning a fixed number of decimals as defined by the token's specification."
