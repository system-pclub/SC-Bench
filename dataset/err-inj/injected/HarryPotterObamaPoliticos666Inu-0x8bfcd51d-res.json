While ERC-20 tokens typically use 18 decimal places, the ERC-20 standard does not specify a maximum number of decimal places a token can have. It only requires that a `decimals()` function is implemented to specify the number of decimal places the token uses. This is primarily for display and transaction purposes to define the smallest unit of the token.\n\nTherefore, returning `21` from the `decimals()` function does not violate the ERC-20 standard. It simply means that this particular token can be divided into smaller units than most typical ERC-20 tokens.",

The `_approve` internal function updates the allowance but does not emit any event to notify of this state change, which is a requirement according to the ERC-20 standard. The standard specifies that an \"Approval\" event should be emitted whenever the `approve` function is successfully executed, to ensure transparency and allow applications to react to the change in allowances.",
