According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. Typically, this should return `true` if the transfer was successful and `false` otherwise.\n\nIn the given code, the `transfer` function always returns `false` regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually performs the transfer operation) completes successfully or not. This behavior can mislead users and external contracts interacting with this token contract, as they will receive a response indicating that the transfer failed even when it may have succeeded.\n\n```solidity\nfunction transfer(\n    address recipient,\n    uint256 amount\n) public override returns (bool) {\n    _transfer(_msgSender(), recipient, amount);\n    return false;  // Incorrectly returns false regardless of the success of _transfer\n}\n```\n\nTo comply with the ERC-20 standard, the function should return `true` upon a successful transfer, and the implementation should handle failures appropriately, possibly using `require` statements within the `_transfer` method to revert the transaction in case of errors."
