The function checks that the caller (obtained via `_msgSender()`) has a sufficient allowance from the `sender` account to transfer the specified `amount` of tokens. This is done with the line:\n\n```solidity\nuint256 currentAllowance = _allowances[sender][_msgSender()];\nrequire(currentAllowance >= amount, \"ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance\");\n```\n\nThis check ensures that the `_from` account (`sender`) has deliberately authorized the sender of the message (the caller) by setting an allowance that is at least as large as the `amount` being transferred. If the allowance is not sufficient, the transaction will revert due to the `require` statement. Thus, the function adheres to the ERC-20 standard's requirement for authorization.",
