According to the ERC-721 standard, the function should return `true` if the operator is an approved operator for the owner, and `false` otherwise. However, the implementation in the code returns the negation of the value stored in `_operatorApprovals[owner][operator]`. This means if the operator is approved (`_operatorApprovals[owner][operator]` is `true`), the function incorrectly returns `false`, and if the operator is not approved (`_operatorApprovals[owner][operator]` is `false`), it incorrectly returns `true`. This is the opposite of what the ERC-721 standard specifies.",

This implementation does not adhere to the standard requirement of returning the actual approved address or a zero address if no approval exists."
