This is typically managed by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has been authorized by the `_from` account to spend a specific amount of tokens. The function should verify that `msg.sender` is allowed to transfer the specified `amount` from the `_from` account, and then deduct the `amount` from the allowed balance in `_allowances`.\n\nIn the given code, the `transferFrom` function simply calls `_transfer(sender, recipient, amount)` without any checks on allowances, which violates the ERC-20 standard requirement for authorization checks in token transfers on behalf of others. This can lead to unauthorized transfers, making the function non-compliant with the standard's security requirements.",
