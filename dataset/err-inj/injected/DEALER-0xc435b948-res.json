This is typically managed by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that `msg.sender` has enough allowance to transfer the specified `amount` of tokens from the `_from` address. The function should include a check like:\n\n```solidity\nrequire(_allowances[_from][msg.sender] >= amount, \"ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance\");\n```\n\nAnd should also decrement the allowance appropriately after a successful transfer:\n\n```solidity\n_allowances[_from][msg.sender] = _allowances[_from][msg.sender].sub(amount);\n```\n\nSince these checks and updates to the `_allowances` mapping are missing in the `transferFrom` function, it violates the ERC-20 rule that requires the `_from` account to have deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism."
