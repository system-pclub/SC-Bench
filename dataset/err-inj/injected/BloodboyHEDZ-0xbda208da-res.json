According to the ERC20 standard, it is required to emit a `Transfer` event whenever tokens are transferred, including transfers that result from transactions such as minting or burning tokens. The absence of this event emission in the `_transfer` function means that the contract does not fully comply with the ERC20 standard regarding event notifications, which is a violation of the ERC rules."
