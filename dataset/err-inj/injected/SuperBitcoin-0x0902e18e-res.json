This is typically managed by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has a sufficient allowance to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the `_from` address. However, the provided `transferFrom` function directly calls `_transfer` without any such checks, thereby violating the ERC-20 rule that requires explicit authorization (via allowance mechanism) for transfers on behalf of another address.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that defines the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. In the given code, the function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in a dynamic return value of 11 (since `_decimals` is a constant 8). This modification of the decimal places in the return statement deviates from the expected constant behavior as per the ERC standard, which could lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behaviors in token handling and display across platforms that interact with this token."
