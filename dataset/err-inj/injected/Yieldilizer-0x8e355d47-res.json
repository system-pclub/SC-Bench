The ERC-20 standard specifies that an \"Approval\" event should be emitted whenever the `approve` function is successfully executed to notify external entities (like other smart contracts and blockchain subscribers) of the change in allowance.\n\nIn the given code, the `approve` function calls an internal `_approve` function to set the allowance, but neither the `approve` function nor the `_approve` function emits the \"Approval\" event. This omission means that external observers are not notified of changes in allowances through the event mechanism, which is a requirement of the ERC-20 standard."
