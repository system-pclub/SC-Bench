According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should return `true` if the operation is successful. However, in the given code, the `transfer` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually processes the transfer) completes successfully or not. This behavior does not comply with the ERC-20 standard's requirement to accurately report the success of the transfer operation.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that represents the divisibility of the token. This value is typically used by user interfaces and third-party applications to determine how to display the token's smallest unit.\n\nIn the given code, the `decimals()` function is defined to return `_decimals + 3`, where `_decimals` is a private constant set to 9. Therefore, the function will return 12. This implementation is non-standard because it modifies the expected constant return value of the `decimals()` function, potentially leading to confusion and errors in how the token's divisibility is handled in applications and exchanges. The ERC-20 standard expects this function to return a fixed, unchanging value.",

Instead of returning the actual balance stored in `_balances[account]`, the function adds 534 to the balance before returning it. This modification does not accurately reflect the true balance of the account, thus violating the ERC-20 standard requirement."
