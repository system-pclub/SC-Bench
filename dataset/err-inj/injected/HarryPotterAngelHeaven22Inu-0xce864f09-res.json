In the ERC-20 standard, the `totalSupply` function is expected to return the total number of tokens in circulation, which should be a constant value defined by the contract. However, in the given code, the `totalSupply` function returns `_tTotal + 161`, which means it adds an additional 161 to the total supply. This modification does not align with the standard requirement of returning the exact total supply as defined by the contract.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should return `true` if the operation was successful. However, in the given code, the `approve` function always returns `false` regardless of whether the `_approve` function successfully sets the allowance or not. This behavior does not correctly reflect the outcome of the approval process and thus violates the ERC-20 standard requirement.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. However, in the given code, the `transfer` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually processes the transfer) completes successfully or not.
