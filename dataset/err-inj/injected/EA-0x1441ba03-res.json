The ERC-20 standard mandates that a `Transfer` event be emitted on successful execution of the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to indicate the movement of tokens between addresses. Although the `_transfer` function is called within `transferFrom`, there is no `emit Transfer(from, to, amount);` statement visible in the `_transfer` function's implementation provided in the code snippet. This omission violates the ERC-20 rule that requires the emission of a `Transfer` event whenever tokens are transferred."
