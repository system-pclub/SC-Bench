The function `_checkOnERC721Received` in the code is supposed to handle this check, but it is implemented to always return `true` without actually performing any check to determine if the recipient address is a contract and if it correctly implements the `onERC721Received` function. This results in a failure to comply with the ERC-721 standard requirement for safe transfers to contracts.",

The function implementation incorrectly adds 827 to the actual balance `_balances[owner]`, which does not accurately reflect the number of NFTs owned by the specified address. This modification leads to an incorrect and misleading return value, thus violating the ERC-721 standard requirement."
