The function should verify that the `msg.sender` is authorized to spend at least `amount` tokens from the `sender`'s account by checking this allowance mapping and then updating it accordingly.\n\nSince the provided code lacks this mechanism and does not perform any checks related to allowances or explicit authorization, it violates the ERC-20 rule that requires verification of authorization before transferring funds from one account to another on behalf of the `_from` account."
