This is because the `ownerOf` function in the `ERC721` contract is incorrectly implemented to always return `address(254)`, which is not a valid or expected behavior. This incorrect implementation means that the `_isApprovedOrOwner` function, which relies on `ownerOf` to determine the actual owner of the token, will not function correctly. As a result, the check for whether `msg.sender` is the owner, an authorized operator, or an approved address will not operate as intended, leading to potential unauthorized transfers.
