According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transfer` function should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. Typically, this should return `true` if the transfer was successful.\n\nHowever, in the provided code, the `transfer` function is implemented as follows:\n\n```solidity\nfunction transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {\n    _transfer(_msgSender(), recipient, amount);\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually processes the transfer) completes successfully or not. This is misleading and incorrect as per the ERC-20 standard, which expects the function to return `true` on successful transfer of tokens."
