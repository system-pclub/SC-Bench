According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the amount of tokens that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from an owner. However, in the provided code, the function returns the value from the `_allowances` mapping plus an additional 462 tokens. This modification does not accurately reflect the actual allowed amount set by the owner for the spender, thus violating the standard's requirement.",
            "YES\n\nThe provided `transferFrom` function in the `Shibarium2` contract does not explicitly check if the `_from` account has authorized the sender of the message to spend tokens on its behalf. The function simply calls `_transfer(sender, recipient, amount)` without verifying if the `msg.sender` has an adequate allowance set in the `_allowances` mapping for the `sender` account. This behavior violates the ERC-20 standard rule that requires checking if the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender via some mechanism, typically by ensuring the `msg.sender` has a sufficient allowance.",
            "YES\n\nThe provided code for the `approve` function in the `Shibarium2` contract does not emit an 'Approval' event as required by the ERC-20 standard. The ERC-20 standard mandates that an 'Approval' event be emitted whenever the `approve` function is successfully executed. This event is crucial for tracking the approvals in a transparent manner on the blockchain.\n\nIn the given code, the `_approve` helper function only sets the allowance but does not handle the emission of the 'Approval' event. This omission means that the contract does not comply with the ERC-20 standard regarding event emissions, which could lead to issues with ERC-20 token trackers and other applications expecting these events to be emitted."
