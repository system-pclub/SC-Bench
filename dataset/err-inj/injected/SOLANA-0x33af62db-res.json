According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from an owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns the value of `_allowances[owner][spender]` incremented by 520, which does not accurately represent the amount that has been authorized by the owner for the spender. This modification to the return value deviates from the standard's requirement and can lead to incorrect behavior in interactions with other contracts or services that expect strict adherence to the ERC-20 standard."
