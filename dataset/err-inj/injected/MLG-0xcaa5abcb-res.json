This is typically used for display and transaction purposes to define the smallest unit of the token. \n\nIn the provided code, the `decimals` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in `11` decimal places. While this is unusual (as most tokens use up to 18 decimals, with 18 being very common due to its compatibility with Ethereum's Wei), it does not violate the ERC-20 standard as long as the function correctly reports the number of decimals used throughout the contract for calculations involving token amounts. The ERC-20 standard allows for flexibility in the choice of decimals.",

According to ERC-20 standards, the `approve` function should return a boolean indicating whether the approval was successful. In this implementation, the function does not accurately reflect the outcome of the approval operation, as it should return `true` upon a successful approval (i.e., after successfully setting the allowance and emitting the Approval event). The constant return of `false` misleads the function callers about the success of the operation, thus violating the ERC-20 rule that states the function should indicate whether the approval was successful.",
