According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the transfer. In the given code, the `transferFrom` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually performs the transfer) completes successfully or not. This implementation can mislead other contracts or services interacting with this token contract into thinking that all transfers have failed, even when they may have succeeded. This is not compliant with the standard behavior expected from an ERC-20 token's `transferFrom` function.",

This is typically managed by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has a sufficient allowance to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the `_from` account. However, the provided `transferFrom` function simply calls `_transfer` without any such checks, thereby violating the ERC-20 rule that requires explicit authorization for transfers from an account."
