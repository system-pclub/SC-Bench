In the given code, the `approve` function and the `_approve` helper function update the allowance but do not emit any event. This omission means the contract does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard regarding event emissions.",

This is typically done by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has a sufficient allowance to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the `_from` account. However, the `transferFrom` function in the code snippet provided does not perform this check, thus violating the ERC-20 rule that requires such authorization."
