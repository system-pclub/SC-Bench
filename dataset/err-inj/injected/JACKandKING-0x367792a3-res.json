            "YES\n\nThe provided code for the `safeTransferFrom` function in the `JACKandKING` contract, which inherits behavior from the `ERC721` contract, does not explicitly check if the `tokenId` is valid before proceeding with the transfer. According to the ERC-721 standard, the function should throw an error if the `tokenId` does not represent a valid NFT. However, the code does not include a direct check to ensure that the `tokenId` exists or is owned by the `from` address before executing the transfer.\n\nWhile the `_transfer` function, called by `_safeTransfer`, does include a requirement that `to` cannot be the zero address and implicitly relies on the correct adjustment of balances (which would fail if `tokenId` is not valid due to the balance check), it does not explicitly validate the existence of `tokenId`. This could potentially lead to issues if the internal state is inconsistent or if there are overrides in other parts of the contract that affect these checks.\n\nTherefore, the implementation could be considered as not fully compliant with the ERC-721 standard regarding the validation of `tokenId` before performing a transfer, unless such validation is guaranteed elsewhere in the contract's logic not visible in the provided code snippet.",
