The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `symbol()` function should be a view function returning a string that represents the token's symbol. In the provided contract, the `symbol()` function is not explicitly defined, but the symbol is stored as a private constant string `_symbol` initialized to \"XBOT\". \n\nHowever, since the contract does not provide a public or external `symbol()` function that returns this value, it does not directly violate the ERC-20 standard but rather omits this optional function. The contract could be considered non-compliant if the ERC-20 interface is expected to be fully implemented, but it does not violate the rule by implementing the function incorrectly. It simply lacks the function, which might limit its interaction standard as an ERC-20 token in some contexts.",

The ERC-20 standard includes an optional `decimals()` function that returns the number of decimals the token uses. However, not implementing this function does not constitute a violation of the ERC-20 standard; it simply means that the contract does not explicitly specify the number of decimals, which might be assumed to be a default (commonly 18 in many interfaces) if not otherwise specified. In the Xbot contract, the decimals are effectively set as a private constant `_decim` with a value of 9, but this is not exposed via a public `decimals()` function, which is a deviation from typical ERC-20 implementations but not a violation of the standard."
