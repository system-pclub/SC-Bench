According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from an owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns the allowance amount with an additional 9 units (`_allowances[owner][spender] + 9`).

According to the ERC-20 standard, functions like `transfer` and `transferFrom` should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. In the provided code, the `transferFrom` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` and `_approve` operations were successful or not. This does not correctly reflect the outcome of the token transfer operation, which is a violation of the ERC-20 standard requirements.",

The ERC-20 standard does not specify a fixed number of decimals; it only requires that a `decimals` function is implemented to return the number of decimal places the token uses. This is typically used for display and transaction purposes to define the smallest unit of the token.\n\nIn the given code, the `decimals` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in 12 decimal places (`9 + 3`). While this is unusually high compared to many commonly used tokens (which often use 18 or fewer decimals), it is still a valid implementation under the ERC-20 standard as long as the function returns a consistent and correct number of decimals for the token's operations. The ERC-20 standard does not impose a maximum limit on the number of decimals."
