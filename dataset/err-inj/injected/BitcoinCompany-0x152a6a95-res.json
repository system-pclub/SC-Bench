This is typically managed through the `_allowances` mapping, which records how much a spender is allowed to transfer from an owner's account.\n\nIn the provided code, the `transferFrom` function directly calls `_transfer` without verifying if the `msg.sender` has enough allowance to transfer the specified `amount` of tokens from the `sender` to the `recipient`. This omission can lead to unauthorized transfers, violating the ERC-20 rule that requires explicit authorization checks before transferring tokens on behalf of another account.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `symbol()` function should return a non-empty string that represents the symbol of the token. An empty string does not provide meaningful information about the token's symbol, which is essential for identifying the token on platforms and exchanges. Therefore, this implementation violates the ERC-20 rule that requires the `symbol()` function to return a \"string, the symbol of the token\"."
