            "YES\n\nThe provided code violates the ERC-20 rule that requires emitting an \"Approval\" event when the `approve` function is called. The ERC-20 standard specifies that an \"Approval\" event should be emitted whenever the `approve` function is successfully executed. This event is crucial for tracking the approvals in a transparent way, allowing user interfaces and other contracts to react to changes in allowances.\n\nIn the given code, the `approve` function calls `_approve`, but within `_approve`, there is no code to emit the \"Approval\" event. This omission means that the contract does not comply with the ERC-20 standard regarding event emissions upon approvals.",
            "YES\n\nThe code provided does violate the typical ERC-20 token standard rule regarding the `decimals` function. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals` function should return the number of decimal places the token can be divided into, which is used to define the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. \n\nIn the given code, the `decimals` function is modified to return `_decimals + 3`, which means it will return 21 instead of the standard 18 decimals. This alteration can lead to confusion and potential integration issues with wallets and exchanges that expect a standard implementation, as they might assume a different level of divisibility of the token than intended by its creators. This can affect how the token is displayed and transacted, potentially leading to significant discrepancies in token value representation.",
            "NO\n\nThe provided code does not violate the ERC-20 rule that \"_spender overwrites the current allowance with _value.\" However, the code snippet is incomplete in terms of actually setting the allowance value in a state variable (like a mapping typically used in ERC-20 tokens to track allowances). The `_approve` function includes checks for zero addresses but does not show the logic for setting or overwriting the allowance value. \n\nFor a complete and compliant implementation, the `_approve` function should modify a state variable that records the allowance for each owner-spender pair. This is typically done using a mapping, such as `mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) private _allowances;` and then setting `_allowances[owner][spender] = amount;` within the `_approve` function. \n\nSince the actual allowance setting is not shown in the provided code, it's not possible to definitively say the rule is violated based on this snippet alone. However, assuming the implementation eventually sets the allowance correctly in the full contract code, the interface itself (as shown) does not violate the ERC-20 rule."
