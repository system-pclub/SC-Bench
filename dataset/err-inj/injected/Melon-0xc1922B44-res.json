However, the `_approve` function's implementation is incomplete as it does not show the actual updating of the allowance value in the contract's state. This is typically done by setting a mapping value that tracks allowances, but the code snippet provided does not include this part. Despite this omission in the snippet, the intention and structure of the `approve` function align with the ERC-20 standard's requirement.",

The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `decimals` function should return the number of decimal places the token can be divided into for display and transaction purposes. While the typical value is 18, to mimic the relationship between Ether and Wei, the standard does not enforce a specific number of decimals; it only requires that the function returns a uint8 value indicating the number of decimals.\n\nIn the provided code, the `decimals` function returns `18 + 3`, which equals 21. This is still a valid uint8 value (as the maximum for uint8 is 255), and thus it does not violate the ERC-20 standard. The choice of decimals is up to the implementer, and while unusual, it is not against the rules."
