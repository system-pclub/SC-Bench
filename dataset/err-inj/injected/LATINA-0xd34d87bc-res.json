The ERC-20 standard specifies that an \"Approval\" event should be emitted whenever the `approve` function is successfully executed to notify external entities (like other smart contracts and interfaces) of the approval.\n\nIn the given code, the `approve` function calls `_approve`, which sets the allowance but does not emit any event. The absence of an \"Approval\" event emission in the `_approve` function or anywhere in the `approve` function means that this implementation does not comply with the ERC-20 standard regarding event emissions.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should return a boolean value that indicates whether the operation was successful. Returning `false` consistently, regardless of the actual outcome of the transfer operation, is misleading and incorrect as per the standard's requirements. This could lead to incorrect assumptions in other contracts or services interacting with this token, expecting a `true` value upon a successful transfer."
