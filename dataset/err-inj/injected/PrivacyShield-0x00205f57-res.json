While this is an unusual choice since most ERC20 tokens use `18` decimals to align with Ether's smallest unit (Wei), it does not violate the ERC20 standard's rule regarding the number of decimal places a token can be divided into. The ERC20 standard does not specify a maximum number of decimals; it only requires that the function `decimals()` be implemented to define the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. Therefore, returning `21` is technically compliant with the ERC20 standard, although it is unconventional.",
