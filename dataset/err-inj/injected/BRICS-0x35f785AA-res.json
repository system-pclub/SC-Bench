According to the ERC-20 standard, functions like `transfer` and `transferFrom` should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. In the given code, the `transferFrom` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually performs the token transfer) completes successfully or not. This implementation can mislead users and external contracts interacting with this token, as they will receive a response indicating that the transfer failed even when it may have succeeded. This does not comply with the standard practice of returning `true` upon a successful transfer operation.",
