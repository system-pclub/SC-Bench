According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that defines the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. In the given code, the function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in 21 decimal places. This is not a constant return value as expected by the standard, since it modifies the originally defined `_decimals` value of 18 by adding 3 to it. This could lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior in token handling and display across platforms that assume a stable decimal value as per the ERC-20 standard.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should return `true` if the operation was successful. However, in the given code, the `approve` function always returns `false` regardless of the successful execution of the `_approve` function. This behavior does not correctly indicate the outcome of the approval process, thereby violating the ERC-20 standard requirement.",
