According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from an owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns the value of `_allowances[owner][spender]` incremented by 730. This modification of the allowance value does not accurately reflect the actual approved amount, thus violating the ERC-20 rule that specifies the allowance function must return the exact remaining amount allowed for withdrawal.",
            "YES\n\nExplanation:\nThe ERC-20 standard requires that the `symbol()` function of a token contract should return a string representing the symbol of the token. According to the provided code, the `symbol()` function returns an empty string (`\"\"`). This does not meet the typical expectation of a token symbol, which is generally a non-empty string that identifies the token. Therefore, returning an empty string can be considered a violation of the ERC-20 standard's requirement for a meaningful token symbol.",
            "YES\n\nThe provided code for the `_transfer` function in the `HPEOS6I` contract does not include an `emit Transfer(from, to, amount);` statement, which is required by the ERC-20 standard to log transfer events. This omission violates the ERC rules that mandate emitting a `Transfer` event whenever tokens are transferred."
