Instead of returning just the balance associated with the address `account`, the function modifies the balance by adding a constant value of 470 to the result of `tokenFromReflection(_rOwned[account])`. This alteration means the function does not strictly return the actual balance of the account, thus violating the ERC-20 standard requirement.",
            "NO.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard does not specify a fixed number of decimals; it only requires that a `decimals` function is implemented to return the number of decimal places the token can be divided into. This is typically used for display and transaction purposes to define the smallest unit of the token. \n\nIn the provided code, the `decimals` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in 12 decimal places. While this is unusual as most tokens use up to 18 decimal places (like Ether), it does not violate the ERC-20 standard. The standard allows for flexibility in the number of decimals, as long as the function correctly reports this number. Thus, the implementation, although unconventional, does not violate the ERC-20 rule regarding decimals.",
