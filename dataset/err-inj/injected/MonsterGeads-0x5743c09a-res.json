This alteration means it does not return the true balance of the owner for the token type requested, which could be considered a violation of the expected behavior as per the ERC standards. However, the interface itself (as defined by function signatures and expected behaviors in comments and standards documentation) does not violate the rule; the issue lies in the specific implementation within the function.",
