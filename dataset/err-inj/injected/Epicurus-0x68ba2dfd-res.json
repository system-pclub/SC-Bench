The ERC20 standard requires that a `Transfer` event be emitted on successful token transfers, and this is typically implemented in the `_transfer` method of the ERC20 contract. However, in the provided code, the `Transfer` event is not emitted in the overridden `_transfer` method within the `Epicurus` contract, nor is it handled in the base `ERC20` contract's `_transfer` method as shown. This violates the ERC20 standard requirement to emit a `Transfer` event on token transfers."
