In the ERC-20 standard, the `totalSupply` function is expected to return a constant value representing the total number of tokens in circulation. However, in the given code, the `totalSupply` function returns `_tTotal + 693`, which is not just the total tokens initially defined but includes an additional 693 tokens. This does not accurately represent the constant total supply as required by the standard.",
            "YES\n\nThe code provided for the `allowance` function in the `StakeNetwork` contract violates the ERC-20 standard rule regarding the allowance function. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the amount of tokens that the spender is still allowed to withdraw from the owner's account. However, in the provided code, the function returns the value from the `_allowances` mapping plus an additional 181 tokens. This modification does not accurately reflect the actual allowed amount set by the owner for the spender, thus violating the standard's requirement.",

Although the actual updating of the allowance mapping (`allowances[owner][spender] = amount;`) is not shown in the provided code snippet, the function emits an `Approval` event with the new allowance amount, which is consistent with the ERC-20 standard's requirement to overwrite the current allowance with the new value.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard mandates that the `approve` function should set the allowance for a spender over the owner's tokens to a new value, and the provided implementation adheres to this by calling `_approve` which handles the logic for setting this new allowance. The absence of the actual mapping update in the snippet is likely due to the snippet being incomplete rather than an indication of non-compliance."
