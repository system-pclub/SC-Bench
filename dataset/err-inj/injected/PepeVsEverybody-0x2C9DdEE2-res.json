According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should return `true` if the approval is successful. However, in the given code, the function always returns `false` regardless of whether the `_approve` internal function executes successfully or not. This implementation does not correctly communicate the outcome of the approval process to the caller, which is against the ERC-20 standard's requirements.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from an owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns the value of `_allowances[owner][spender]` incremented by 502. This modification does not accurately reflect the actual allowed amount, thus violating the standard's requirement for this function.",

This mapping is essential for tracking how much a spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the owner.\n\nFurthermore, the `approve` function returns `false` unconditionally, which is unconventional and misleading. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should return `true` to indicate successful approval (assuming no exceptions were thrown).\n\nTherefore, the implementation violates the ERC-20 standard by not properly setting the allowance and by not returning the correct boolean value."
