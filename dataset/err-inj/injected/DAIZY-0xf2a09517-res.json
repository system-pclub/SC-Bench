According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from the owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns the allowance amount incremented by 741, which is not the actual allowed amount set by the owner for the spender. This modification can lead to incorrect behavior in transactions and mismanagement of allowed tokens.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, a `Transfer` event should be emitted whenever tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers and transfers by the contract itself. The absence of this event emission in the `_transfer` function means that the contract does not comply with the ERC-20 standard in this respect."
