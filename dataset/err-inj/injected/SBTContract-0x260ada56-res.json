If this returns `false`, the function incorrectly returns `true`, which is contrary to the expected behavior. Furthermore, if `_isAllowed(owner, operator)` returns `true`, the function then negates the result of `super.isApprovedForAll(owner, operator)`, which again can lead to incorrect results depending on the state of `_operatorApprovals` in the base contract `ERC721Psi`.\n\nThis inversion of logic can lead to scenarios where an operator who is not approved appears to be approved and vice versa, which is a direct violation of the ERC-721 standard requirements for the `isApprovedForAll` function."
