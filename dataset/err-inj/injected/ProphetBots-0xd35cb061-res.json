According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from the owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns the allowance amount with an additional 550 units added to it (`_allowances[owner][spender] + 550`). This modification does not accurately reflect the actual approved allowance and thus violates the standard's requirement.",

The `_approve` internal function updates the allowance but does not emit any event. According to the ERC-20 standard, an \"Approval\" event should be emitted whenever the `approve` function is successfully executed to notify external entities of the change in allowance. The absence of this event emission in the code means it does not fully comply with the ERC-20 standard."
