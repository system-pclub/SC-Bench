According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that defines the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. \n\nIn the given code, the `decimals()` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in a dynamic return value of 12 (since `_decimals` is a constant 9). This implementation does not adhere to the standard practice of returning a fixed number of decimals, as it modifies the expected constant value. This could lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behaviors in token handling and display across platforms that interact with this token."
