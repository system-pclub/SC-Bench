According to the ERC-20 standard, the `totalSupply` function should return the total amount of tokens in circulation or the total amount initially minted, without any modifications or additional calculations.\n\nIn the given code, the function returns `_tTotal + 131`, which adds an arbitrary number (131) to the total supply. This modification does not reflect the actual total supply as defined by the ERC-20 standard and thus violates the rule that requires the function to return the unaltered total token supply.",
            "NO\n\nThe provided code does not violate the ERC-20 rule that \"_spender overwrites the current allowance with _value.\" The function `_approve` in the contract `AITrade` is designed to set the allowance of `spender` by the `owner` to the `amount` specified. The `emit Approval(owner, spender, amount);` line indicates that an `Approval` event is emitted with the new allowance amount, which is a typical way to signal that the allowance has been updated in ERC-20 tokens.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the actual updating of the allowance mapping (`allowances[owner][spender] = amount;`) is not shown in the provided code snippet. This is a crucial part of the implementation that should be present in the full contract to ensure that the allowance is indeed overwritten. The absence of this line in the snippet does not necessarily mean the rule is violated; it might simply be omitted from the snippet provided. The key aspect is that the intention and structure of the code align with the ERC-20 requirement to overwrite the current allowance with the new value.",
