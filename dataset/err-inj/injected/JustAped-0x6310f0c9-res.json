Returning an empty string does not adhere to the typical expectation of providing a meaningful token symbol, thus it can be considered as violating the ERC-20 rule that requires a token symbol to be a string representing the token.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`. However, in the given code, the function returns `_allowances[owner][spender] + 329`, which adds an arbitrary number (329) to the actual allowance amount. This modification does not accurately reflect the remaining allowance as per the original agreement between the `_owner` and `_spender`, thus violating the standard's requirement."
