            "YES\n\nThe provided `transferFrom` function in the `Froge` contract does not check whether the `_from` account has authorized the `msg.sender` to transfer tokens on its behalf. This is typically managed through an allowance mechanism, which is standard in ERC-20 tokens but is missing in this implementation. The function directly calls `_transfer` without verifying any allowances set by the `_from` address for the `msg.sender`, thus violating the ERC-20 rule that requires explicit authorization for transfers from a user's account by another party.",
            "YES\n\nThe function `totalSupply()` in the provided code violates the ERC-20 rule that requires it to return the total token supply. Instead of returning a constant total supply, the function adds an arbitrary number (586) to `_tTotal`, which deviates from the expected behavior of simply returning the predefined total supply of tokens. According to ERC-20 standards, the `totalSupply()` function should return the total amount of tokens in circulation, which should be a constant value if defined as such, without any additional calculations or modifications.",
            "YES\n\nThe provided code for the `approve` function in the `Froge` contract does indeed violate the ERC-20 rule that \"_spender overwrites the current allowance with _value.\" The `_approve` function in the code simply emits an `Approval` event with the owner, spender, and amount, but it does not actually update any state variable to record the new allowance value. In a typical ERC-20 token implementation, there should be a mapping (e.g., `mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) private _allowances;`) that keeps track of allowances set by token owners for different spenders. The `_approve` function should update this mapping to reflect the new allowance amount.\n\nSince the code does not show any update to such a mapping or any similar mechanism to store the approved amounts, it does not adhere to the ERC-20 standard requirement of actually setting the allowance in a way that can be later checked and enforced. This could lead to functional issues where the allowance is not correctly enforced during token transfers or other operations that depend on these allowances."
