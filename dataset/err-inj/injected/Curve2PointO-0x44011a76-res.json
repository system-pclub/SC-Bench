According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. Typically, this should return `true` if the approval was successfully recorded.\n\nIn the provided code, the `approve` function always returns `false` regardless of whether the `_approve` function successfully sets the allowance or not. This implementation can mislead other contracts or services interacting with this contract into thinking that the approval has failed when it may have succeeded. This behavior does not align with the standard practice and expectations set by the ERC-20 token standard."
