The ERC-20 standard specifies that the `decimals()` function is used to define how many decimal places a token has for display and transaction purposes, but it does not enforce a specific number of decimals that must be used. The function simply returns the number of decimals, and the actual value is determined by the contract's implementation.\n\nIn the given code, the function returns `_decimals + 9`. While this might be unusual or non-standard if `_decimals` is not set to a typical value like 9 (resulting in 18 decimals, which is common for many ERC-20 tokens), it does not inherently violate the ERC-20 standard. The standard allows for flexibility in the number of decimals a token can have. The only requirement is that the function correctly reports whatever decimal value is used throughout the token's contract and transactions.",
