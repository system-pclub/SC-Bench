However, in the given code, the function returns the value of `_allowances[owner][spender]` incremented by 861, which does not accurately reflect the allowed amount.

However, in the given code, the `transfer` function is implemented to always return `false`, regardless of whether the transfer operation was actually successful or not.

Typically, this should return `true` if the approval was successfully recorded.\n\nIn the given code, the `approve` function always returns `false` regardless of whether the `_approve` function successfully sets the allowance or not.
