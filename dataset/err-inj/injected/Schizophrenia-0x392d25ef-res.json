According to the ERC-20 standard, the `totalSupply` function should consistently return the total amount of tokens in circulation. In the given code, the `totalSupply` function is returning `_tTotal + 420`, which means it is artificially inflating the total supply by 420 tokens. This does not accurately represent the total number of tokens initially defined by `_tTotal`, thus violating the ERC-20 requirement for the `totalSupply` function.",

According to ERC-20 standards, the `symbol()` function should return a string that represents the symbol of the token. Returning an empty string technically violates the informal expectation or guideline that the token should have a meaningful symbol, which is typically a short string identifying the token. However, it does not technically violate the ERC-20 standard itself, as the standard does not specify what the string should contain, only that it should return a string. Nonetheless, returning an empty string is generally not useful for the purposes of identifying the token in interfaces and applications, which expect a non-empty and meaningful symbol."
