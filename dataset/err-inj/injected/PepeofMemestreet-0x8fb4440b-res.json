According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that defines the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. In the given code, the function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in a dynamic return value of 11 instead of the constant 8 defined by `_decimals`. This implementation can lead to confusion and inconsistency in how the token's decimal places are handled across platforms and contracts, which is contrary to the purpose of having a standard method to define token divisibility.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from an owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns the value of `_allowances[owner][spender]` incremented by 828, which does not accurately reflect the actual allowed amount.
