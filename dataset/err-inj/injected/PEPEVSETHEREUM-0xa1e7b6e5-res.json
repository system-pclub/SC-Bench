According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from an owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns the allowance amount incremented by 57 (`_allowances[owner][spender] + 57`), which does not accurately represent the actual allowed amount. This modification can lead to incorrect behavior in interactions with other contracts or services that rely on the correct allowance values.",

The function in the provided code returns 12 (`_decimals + 3`), which is a valid return value. The ERC-20 standard does not specify a maximum or minimum number of decimals; it only requires that the function returns a uint8 indicating the number of decimal places. Therefore, this function does not violate the ERC-20 rule regarding decimals."
