Instead of returning the actual balance from `_balances[account]`, the function adds 467 to the balance, which modifies the expected result.

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `approve` function should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. Typically, this should return `true` when the approval is successfully processed.\n\nHowever, in the provided code, the `approve` function is hardcoded to always return `false`, regardless of whether the approval was actually successful or not. This implementation does not correctly communicate the outcome of the approval to the caller, which is against the ERC-20 standard's requirement to indicate the success of the approval operation.",

While ERC20 tokens typically use 18 decimals, the ERC20 standard does not specify a maximum number of decimals a token can have. The number of decimals is used primarily for display purposes and does not affect the underlying arithmetic operations of the contract. Therefore, returning `21` does not violate the ERC20 standard's rules regarding decimals."
