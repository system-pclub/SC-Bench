This is typically managed by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has enough allowance to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the `_from` account. However, the provided `transferFrom` function directly calls `_transfer` without any such checks, thereby violating the ERC-20 rule that requires explicit authorization. This oversight can lead to unauthorized transfers, making the function non-compliant with the standard ERC-20 requirements.",
