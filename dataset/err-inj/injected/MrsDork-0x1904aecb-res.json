Instead of returning a constant total supply, it adds 466 to `_tTotal`, which alters the expected total supply of tokens. According to ERC-20 standards, the `totalSupply()` function should consistently return the total amount of tokens in circulation, which should be a fixed value if the token supply is constant. The addition of 466 to the total supply is not in compliance with this requirement.",

This is typically done by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has been granted a sufficient allowance to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the `_from` account.
