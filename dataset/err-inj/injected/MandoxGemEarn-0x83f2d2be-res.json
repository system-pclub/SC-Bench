According to ERC-721 standards, the function should revert (throw an error) if the address querying for the balance is the zero address, as NFTs should not be assigned to the zero address. This is a safeguard to prevent errors and misuse in the handling of token ownership.\n\nThe correct implementation should include a condition to check if the `owner` is the zero address and throw an error if true.
