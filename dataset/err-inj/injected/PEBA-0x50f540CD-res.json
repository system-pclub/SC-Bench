The ERC-20 standard does not specify a fixed number of decimals; it only requires that a `decimals()` function is implemented to return the number of decimal places the token uses. This is typically used for display and transaction purposes to define the smallest unit of the token.\n\nIn the given code, the `decimals()` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in 12 decimal places (`9 + 3`). While this is unusually high compared to many popular tokens (which often use 18 or fewer decimals), it is still a valid implementation as long as it consistently represents the token's smallest unit across the system. The ERC-20 standard does not impose a maximum limit on the number of decimals.",
