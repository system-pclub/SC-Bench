This is typically managed through an allowance mechanism in ERC-20 tokens, where the `_from` account must explicitly set an allowance for the `sender` using the `approve` function. The `transferFrom` function should then verify that the `sender` is allowed to transfer the specified amount of tokens by checking this allowance and should decrement the allowance by the transferred amount upon a successful transfer.\n\nIn the provided code, the `transferFrom` function simply calls `_transfer(sender, recipient, amount)` without any checks for such an allowance, and then returns `false`, which is also non-standard behavior as successful token transfers should return `true`. This behavior violates the ERC-20 standard requirement that states \"throw if the `_from` account has not deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism\".",
