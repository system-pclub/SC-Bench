According to the ERC-20 standard, functions like `transfer` and `transferFrom` should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. In the provided code, the `transferFrom` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` operation (which actually performs the token transfer) succeeds or fails. This implementation does not correctly communicate the outcome of the token transfer to the caller, which is a violation of the ERC-20 standard requirements.",

The ERC-20 standard specifies that an 'Approval' event should be emitted whenever the `approve` function is successfully executed to notify external entities (like other smart contracts and interfaces) of the change in allowance. The code snippet provided does not include an emit statement for the 'Approval' event in the `_approve` function or anywhere else within the `approve` function implementation.
