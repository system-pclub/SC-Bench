In the provided code, the `totalSupply` function is overridden to return `_totalSupply + 602`, which artificially inflates the reported total supply by 602 tokens. This is not standard behavior for an ERC-20 token, as the `totalSupply` function is expected to return the exact total number of tokens that are currently in circulation or have been minted.",

This behavior violates the ERC-20 standard, which requires that the `transferFrom` function should return `true` if the operation is successful. The ERC-20 standard specifies that functions like `transfer` and `transferFrom` should return a boolean value indicating the success of the operation, typically `true` for success and `false` for failure. In this contract, the function performs the transfer but then incorrectly returns `false` every time, which can mislead other contracts or services interacting with this token contract about the success of the transfer."
