However, this check is missing in the provided `transferFrom` function implementation, which violates the ERC-20 standard rule that requires such authorization.",

This does not accurately represent the total token supply as initially defined or intended, as it artificially inflates the number by 864. This is not compliant with the standard behavior expected from the `totalSupply()` function as per the ERC-20 token standard."
