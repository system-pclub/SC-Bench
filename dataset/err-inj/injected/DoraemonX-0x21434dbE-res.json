Returning an empty string does not adhere to the typical usage and expectation of a token symbol in ERC-20 tokens, which is generally a non-empty string. Therefore, this implementation can be considered as violating the ERC-20 standard requirement for a token symbol.",

The ERC-20 standard does not specify a fixed number of decimals that must be used; it only requires that the function `decimals()` be implemented to return the number of decimal places the token can be divided into. This is typically used to define the smallest unit of the token. The actual number returned by `decimals()` can vary between different tokens, and there is no rule in the ERC-20 standard that restricts the value to a specific number. Therefore, returning `12` does not violate the ERC-20 standard regarding the number of decimals."
