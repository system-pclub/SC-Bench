This violates the ERC-721 rule that requires the function to throw an error if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT.

The `_checkOnERC721Received` function is stubbed to always return `true`, which means it does not perform any actual check to determine if the recipient address (`to`) is a contract and if it correctly implements the `IERC721Receiver` interface.\n\nAccording to the ERC-721 standard, when transferring tokens to a contract, the contract must implement the `IERC721Receiver` interface and return a specific magic value when `onERC721Received` is called. This is crucial to prevent tokens from being locked in contracts that do not expect to receive them.
