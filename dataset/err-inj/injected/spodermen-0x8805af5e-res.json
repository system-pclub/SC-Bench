According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from an owner. However, in the given code, the function returns the allowance amount with an additional 243 units added to it (`_allowances[owner][spender] + 243`), which does not accurately reflect the actual allowed amount. This modification can lead to incorrect behavior in interactions with other contracts or services that rely on the correct allowance values.",

Instead of returning the constant total supply `_tTotal`, the function adds an additional 909 to `_tTotal`, which results in a value that does not represent the actual total supply of tokens as initially defined. This modification does not comply with the standard requirement of returning the unaltered total token supply."
