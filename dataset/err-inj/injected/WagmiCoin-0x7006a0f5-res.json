According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from the owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns the allowance amount with an additional 831 added to it (`_allowances[owner][spender] + 831`), which does not accurately represent the actual allowed amount. This modification can lead to incorrect behavior in interactions with other contracts or services that rely on the correct allowance values."
