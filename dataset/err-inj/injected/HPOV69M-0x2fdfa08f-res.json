According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the amount of tokens that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from an owner. However, in the given code, the function returns `_allowances[owner][spender] + 296`, which artificially inflates the allowed amount by 296 tokens. This modification does not accurately reflect the actual allowed amount set through the `approve` function, thus violating the standard's requirement."
