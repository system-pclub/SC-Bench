However, in the provided code, there is no such check in the `transferFrom` function or within the `_transfer` function that it calls.

Instead of returning the actual balance from the `_balances` mapping, the function adds 600 to the balance, which is not compliant with the standard definition of the `balanceOf` function as per the ERC-20 token standard.
