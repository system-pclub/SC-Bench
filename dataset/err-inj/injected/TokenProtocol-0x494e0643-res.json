The code does not show the actual updating of a mapping or storage variable that holds the allowance values, but the structure and the function signature suggest that it is intended to overwrite the current allowance with the new `amount` as required by the ERC-20 standard. The absence of explicit code to show the allowance mapping being updated is likely because this is a simplified or partial view of the contract. In a full implementation, `_approve` would typically update a mapping (e.g., `allowances[owner][spender] = amount;`) to reflect the new allowance.",
            "YES\n\nThe code provided does violate the typical ERC-20 token standard rule regarding the `decimals` function. According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals` function should return the number of decimal places the token can be divided into, which is used to define the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. \n\nIn the given code, the `decimals` function is implemented to return `_decimals + 3`, where `_decimals` is initialized to 18. This means the function will return 21, which is not a typical or standard value for ERC-20 tokens. Standard implementations usually set the decimals to a fixed value (commonly 18) and return this value directly without modification. Modifying this value in the way shown in the code could lead to confusion and potential incompatibility with wallets and other contracts expecting a standard implementation."
