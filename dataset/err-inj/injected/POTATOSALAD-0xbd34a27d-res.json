In the provided code, the `transferFrom` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually performs the transfer) completes successfully or not.

The function should decrement the allowance by the amount being transferred after ensuring it is sufficient.\n\nIn the provided code, the `transferFrom` function simply calls `_transfer` without any checks related to allowances, which violates the ERC-20 standard requirement that states \"throw if the _from account has not deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism\".
