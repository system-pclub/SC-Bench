According to the ERC-20 standard, functions like `transfer` and `transferFrom` should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. In the provided code, the `transferFrom` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually performs the token transfer) completes successfully or not. This behavior can mislead other contracts or services interacting with this token contract into thinking that all transfers have failed, even when they may have succeeded. This is a critical issue and does not comply with the standard's requirements."
