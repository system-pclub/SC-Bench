According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that represents the number of decimal places the token uses. This value is intended to be fixed and used to define the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes.\n\nIn the given code, the `decimals()` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in a value of `12` (since `_decimals` is a constant set to `9`). This implementation is not fixed as it programmatically alters the base decimal places, which could lead to confusion or inconsistency in how the token's divisibility is represented and understood. Typically, the decimals value should be a constant, not a calculated or variable one, to maintain standard compliance and ensure consistent token handling across platforms and exchanges.",
