According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from the owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns `_allowances[owner][spender] + 82`, which artificially increases the allowed amount by 82.

Therefore, returning `21` does not violate the ERC-20 rules regarding the implementation of the `decimals()` function."
