This is a requirement according to the ERC-721 standard to ensure that the contract receiving the token can handle it properly, which prevents tokens from being locked in contracts that do not recognize them.\n\nThe `_safeTransfer` function, which is called by `safeTransferFrom`, handles the transfer of the token but does not include any logic to interact with `onERC721Received`. This omission means that the function does not comply with the ERC-721 standard's requirement for safe transfers to contracts."
