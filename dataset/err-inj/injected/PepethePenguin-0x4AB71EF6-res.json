However, the actual updating of the allowance mapping (`allowances[owner][spender] = amount;`) is not shown in the provided code snippet, but the presence of the `Approval` event emission suggests that the allowance is intended to be set or updated in the `_approve` method. The requirement is that the new allowance amount replaces any existing amount, which is typically handled in the `_approve` method, though the actual update line is not visible in the snippet provided. The code adheres to the ERC-20 standard based on the information given."
