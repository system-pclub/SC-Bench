This function is called by the public `approve` function, which takes in a `spender` and an `amount`, and sets the allowance accordingly.\n\nThe ERC-20 standard requires that calling the `approve` function should successfully overwrite the current allowance with the new `amount`. The code provided does exactly this by emitting an `Approval` event with the new allowance amount each time `_approve` is called, which is the standard way of indicating that the allowance has been updated.\n\nTherefore, the implementation adheres to the ERC-20 standard's requirement regarding the behavior of the `approve` function.",
