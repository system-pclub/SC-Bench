According to the ERC-20 standard, the `allowance` function should return the exact amount that a spender is still allowed to withdraw from the owner's account. However, in the given code, the function returns the value of `_allowances[owner][spender]` incremented by 558, which does not accurately represent the allowed amount. This modification can lead to incorrect behavior in transactions and mislead users about the actual allowances set, potentially causing security and functional issues in the contract's operation."
