This is typically done by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has a sufficient allowance to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the `_from` account. However, the code snippet provided does not include such a check in the `transferFrom` or `_transfer` functions, which violates the ERC-20 standard requirement that states \"throw if the _from account has not deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism\".",

In the given implementation, the function returns the balance from the mapping `_balances` but adds an additional 346 to the actual balance. This modification does not accurately reflect the true balance of the account, thus violating the ERC-20 standard requirement.",

According to the ERC20 standard, it is required to emit a `Transfer` event whenever tokens are transferred, including transfers that result from minting or burning tokens. The absence of this event emission in the `_transfer` function means that the contract does not comply with the ERC20 standard in this respect."
