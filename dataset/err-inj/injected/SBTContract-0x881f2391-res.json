            "The provided smart contract `SBTContract` does not violate the ERC-721 rule for the `safeTransferFrom` function. The ERC-721 standard requires that the `safeTransferFrom` function checks if the recipient is a smart contract and, if so, confirms that it can handle ERC-721 tokens by invoking its `onERC721Received` function. This is to prevent tokens from being locked in contracts that do not recognize or cannot handle them.\n\nIn the provided contract, the `safeTransferFrom` function is correctly overridden to include a call to `_checkOnERC721Received`, which performs the necessary check to ensure that the recipient contract can handle the ERC-721 tokens. This is evident from the following segment of the code:\n\n```solidity\nfunction safeTransferFrom(\n    address from,\n    address to,\n    uint256 tokenId,\n    bytes memory _data\n) public override onlyAllowedOperator(from) {\n    super.safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId, _data);\n}\n```\n\nAnd the `_safeTransfer` function, which is called by `safeTransferFrom`, includes the check:\n\n```solidity\nfunction _safeTransfer(\n    address from,\n    address to,\n    uint256 tokenId,\n    bytes memory _data\n) internal virtual {\n    _transfer(from, to, tokenId);\n    require(\n        _checkOnERC721Received(from, to, tokenId, 1,_data),\n        \"ERC721Psi: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer\"\n    );\n}\n```\n\nHere, `_checkOnERC721Received` is used to ensure that the contract at address `to` can handle the token, complying with the ERC-721 standard. Therefore, the answer is **NO**, the `SBTContract` does not violate the ERC-721 rule for the `safeTransferFrom` function.",
