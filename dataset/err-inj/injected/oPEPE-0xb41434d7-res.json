According to ERC-20 standards, such a check is mandatory to ensure that tokens are only transferred with explicit permission. This is typically managed through the allowance mechanism, where the `_from` account sets an allowance for the `sender` using the `approve` function, and this allowance is checked and updated in the `transferFrom` function.\n\nIn the given code, the `transferFrom` function simply calls `_transfer` without verifying if the `msg.sender` has an adequate allowance set by the `sender` to transfer the specified `amount` of tokens. This violates the ERC-20 rule that requires the sender of the message (in this case, the entity calling `transferFrom`) to be explicitly authorized by the `_from` account. \n\nTherefore, the implementation does not comply with the ERC-20 standard regarding authorization checks in token transfers initiated by third parties.",
