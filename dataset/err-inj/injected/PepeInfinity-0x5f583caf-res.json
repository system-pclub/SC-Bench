This is typically managed by checking the `_allowances` mapping to ensure that the `msg.sender` has enough allowance to transfer the specified amount of tokens from the `_from` account. However, the provided `transferFrom` function directly calls `_transfer` without any such checks, thereby violating the ERC-20 rule that requires explicit authorization for transfers from a third party.",

According to the ERC-20 standard, the `transferFrom` function should return a boolean value that indicates the success of the operation. However, in the given code, the `transferFrom` function always returns `false`, regardless of whether the `_transfer` function (which actually performs the transfer) completes successfully or not. This implementation does not correctly communicate the outcome of the token transfer to the caller, which is a requirement of the ERC-20 standard.",

Instead of returning a constant total supply, the function adds 248 to `_tTotal`, which results in a value that does not represent the actual total supply as initially defined by `_tTotal`. This modification does not adhere to the standard requirement of returning the constant total token supply."
