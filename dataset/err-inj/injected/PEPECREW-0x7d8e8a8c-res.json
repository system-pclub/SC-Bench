According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that defines the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. In the given code, the function returns `_decimals + 3`, which results in a dynamic value (21 in this case) rather than a fixed number of decimals. This can lead to inconsistencies and potential issues in token handling and interoperability across platforms and contracts that expect a stable decimal value.",

This modification does not reflect the true balance of the account, thus violating the ERC-20 standard requirement.",
