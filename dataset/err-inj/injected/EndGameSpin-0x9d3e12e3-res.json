According to the ERC-20 standard, the `decimals()` function should return a constant value that represents the smallest unit of the token for display and transaction purposes. This value is typically used by user interfaces and third-party applications to determine how to display the token amounts properly.\n\nIn the given code, the `decimals()` function returns `_decimals + 3`, which means it does not return a constant value but rather a value that is always 3 more than the `_decimals` constant set at 9. This results in the function returning 12, which can lead to confusion and inconsistency in how the token's decimals are handled across platforms and contracts. This is not in line with the expected behavior of a standard ERC-20 token's `decimals()` function, which should consistently return a fixed number of decimal places."
