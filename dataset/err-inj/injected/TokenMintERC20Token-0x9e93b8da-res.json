The ERC-20 `approve` function should typically update the allowance mapping to reflect the new allowance value for a spender set by the token owner. The correct implementation should look something like this:\n\n```solidity\nmapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) private _allowances;\n\nfunction approve(address spender, uint256 value) public returns (bool) {\n    require(spender != address(0), \"ERC20: approve to the zero address\");\n\n    _allowances[msg.sender][spender] = value;\n    emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, value);\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\nIn the provided code snippet, while it does not violate the rule directly (since it doesn't show the allowance being set incorrectly), it does not actually implement the necessary functionality to manage allowances as per the ERC-20 standard.
