This is a V1 Staking contract for OpenPool LP, this is unaudited software so use at your own risk. 
A V2 contract will be released 1-2 weeks after V1 and will be audited, users will be recommended 
to move to that pool, When the V2 contract is deployed this contract will be discontinued by shutting off 
staking deposits via the stake_lockdown function. Withdraws will remain open, and funds will be added while users are staked.

There is a Bad Actor mapping to tag users who potentially are looking to game the contract, we are watching, you will be seen.
Play Nice, you get one warning.
